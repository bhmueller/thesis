    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors emphasize that the evaluation of marginal returns to policy interventions is one of the central tasks for evaluating the optimal size of social programs. They state that this is an relatively simple task if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.) The effect of a policy intervention is homogeneous.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.) The effect of a policy intervention is heterogeneous given observable variables but agent select not into treatment based on unobservable returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Under condition 1 or 2 it is possible to estimate the mean marginal return to schooling via a simplified mincer framework. Possible selection problems (the decision to attend schooling isn't exogenous) can be solved by applying methods like Instrumental variables. \n",
    "Nevertheless the application of empirically tests for this conditions provide evidence for heterogeneous marginal returns. In addition it seems like agents would select into treatment based on at least partly knowledge about idiosyncratic returns. Therefore the authors make use of a local instrumental variable approach to estimate the marginal return to college attendance within the framework of the generalized Roy model.\n"

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_1$ and $Y_0$  are objective outcomes associated with each potential treatment state $D$ and realized after the treatment decision.\n",
    "From the perspective of the econometrician, $(X,Z)$ are observable while $(U_1,U_0,V)$ are not. $X$ are the observed determinants of potential outcomes $(Y_1,Y_0)$, and $Z$ are the observed determinants of the latent indicator variable $D^{*}$. It is assumed that the unobservable parameters $(U_1,U_0,V)$ follow a joint normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$Y$ illustrates the observable outcome of the individual. Additionally its functional form emphasizes a crucial issue in the econometrics of policy evaluation which is referred to as the **Evaluation Problem**. The problem arises because the econometrician is limited to observe either $Y_1$ or $Y_0$ for the individual dependent on the selection decision $D$. Thus, the effect of treatment cannot be determined on an individual level. If the treatment choice $D$ depends on the potential outcomes, then there is also a selection problem (**Essential Heterogeneity**). If that is the case, then the treated and untreated sub populations differ not only in their treatment status but in other characteristics as well. A naive comparison of the treated and untreated leads to misleading conclusions.\n"

    "# The Marginal Treatment Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the Marginal Treatment Effect, henceforth $B^{MTE}$, was first introduced by Bj√∂rklund and Moffit (1987). It is defined as the gain from treatment to an indifferent individual given a specific degree of unobservable desire for selecting into treatment. Adding our functional form assumptions from above allows us to express $B^{MTE}$ via the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "B^{MTE}(x,u_D) &= E\\left[Y_1 - Y_0 | X=x, U_D = u_D\\right]\\\\\n",
    "& = \\left(\\delta_1 - \\delta_0\\right)x + \\left(\\sigma_{1,V} - \\sigma_{0,V}\\right) \\phi^{-1}(u_D)\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $B^{MTE}$ does not assign explicitly one value as an effect, but rather provides a continuum of effects along the distribution of the unobservable parameter $V$. Additionally it provides the framework for deriving a broad variation of different treatment effects by applying effect specific weights along the distribution of $V$ on the marginal effect.\n"
