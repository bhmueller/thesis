abstract = {The solution of several operations research problems requires the creation of a quantitative model. Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in the model building and result communication process. Through sensitivity analysis we gain essential insights on model behavior, on its structure and on its response to changes in the model inputs. Several interrogations are possible and several sensitivity analysis methods have been developed, giving rise to a vast and growing literature. We present an overview of available methods, structuring them into local and global methods. For local methods, we discuss Tornado diagrams, one way sensitivity functions, differentiation-based methods and scenario decomposition through finite change sensitivity indices, providing a unified view of the associated sensitivity measures. We then analyze global sensitivity methods, first discussing screening methods such as sequential bifurcation and the Morris method. We then address variance-based, moment-independent and value of information-based sensitivity methods. We discuss their formalization in a common rationale and present recent results that permit the estimation of global sensitivity measures by post-processing the sample generated by a traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We then investigate in detail the methodological issues concerning the crucial step of correctly interpreting the results of a sensitivity analysis. A classical example is worked out to illustrate some of the approaches.},

 abstract = {This paper formulates a simple regenerative optimal stopping model of bus engine replacement to describe the behavior of Harold Zurcher, superintendent of maintenance at the Madison (Wisconsin) Metropolitan Bus Company. The null hypothesis is that Zurcher's decisions on bus engine replacement coincide with an optimal stopping rule: a strategy which specifies whether or not to replace the current bus engine each period as a function of observed and unobserved state variables. The optimal stopping rule is the solution to a stochastic dynamic programming problem that formalizes the trade-off between the conflicting objectives of minimizing maintenance costs versus minimizing unexpected engine failures. The model depends on unknown "primitive parameters" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a "bottom-up" approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a "nested fixed point" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.},

  abstract={This book presents a variety of computational methods used to solve dynamic problems in economics and finance. It emphasizes practical numerical methods rather than mathematical proofs and focuses on techniques that apply directly to economic analyses. The examples are drawn from a wide range of subspecialties of economics and finance, with particular emphasis on problems in agricultural and resource economics, macroeconomics, and finance. The book also provides an extensive Web-site library of computer utilities and demonstration programs. The book is divided into two parts. The first part develops basic numerical methods, including linear and nonlinear equation methods, complementarity methods, finite-dimensional optimization, numerical integration and differentiation, and function approximation. The second part presents methods for solving dynamic stochastic models in economics and finance, including dynamic programming, rational expectations, and arbitrage pricing models in discrete and continuous time. The book uses MATLAB to illustrate the algorithms and includes a utilities toolbox to help readers develop their own computational economics applications.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is en route to becoming an integral part of mathematical modeling. The tremendous potential benefits of SA are, however, yet to be fully realized, both for advancing mechanistic and data-driven modeling of human and natural systems, and in support of decision making. In this perspective paper, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners revisit the current status of SA, and outline research challenges in regard to both theoretical frameworks and their applications to solve real-world problems. Six areas are discussed that warrant further attention, including (1) structuring and standardizing SA as a discipline, (2) realizing the untapped potential of SA for systems modeling, (3) addressing the computational burden of SA, (4) progressing SA in the context of machine learning, (5) clarifying the relationship and role of SA to uncertainty quantification, and (6) evolving the use of SA in support of decision making. An outlook for the future of SA is provided that underlines how SA must underpin a wide variety of activities to better serve science and society.}

abstract = {Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can help modelers to better understand the model and manage the uncertainty. However, when the model itself is rather sophisticated, especially when dependence exists among model inputs, it could be difficult or even unfeasible to perform quantitative GSA directly. In this paper, a non-parametric approach is proposed for screening model inputs. It extends the classic Elementary Effects (i.e., Morris) method, which is widely used for screening independent inputs, to enable the screening of dependent model inputs. The performance of the proposed method is tested with three numerical experiments, and the results are cross-compared with those from the variance-based GSA. It is found that the proposed method can properly identify the influential and non-influential inputs from a complex model with several independent and dependent inputs. Furthermore, compared with the variance-based GSA, the proposed screening method only needs a few model runs, while the screening accuracy is well maintained. Therefore, it can be regarded as a practical tool for the initial GSA of high dimensional and computationally expensive models with dependent inputs.}
