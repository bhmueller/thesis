\section{Conclusion}

Interestingly, the Morris method yields the correct inputs ranking. This holds true even for small sample sizes. This is my main finding. It is therefore a valid substitute to Shapley effects if the purpose of sa is importance ranking or FF.

If FF is the purpose, none of the inputs of the Rust model can be fixed. Both, Shapley effects and Morris indices indicate this. This is a secondary finding of my analysis. The inherent uncertainty in the model inputs should not be ignored if one is to use the Rust model for policy making. We cannot assume that we knew neither of the two inputs with certainty.
